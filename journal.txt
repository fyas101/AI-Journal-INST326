Week 1
This week I used AI to help give me some examples while I was completing the week 1 exercises. 
I was a little lost at first since I am fairly new to coding and haven't coded since INST126 but after
asking ChatGPT and Gemini for some example codes using f-strings and strip(), I was able to get a refresher of
these concepts and continue to complete the exercises myself. I did not use AI for debugging.

Week 2
This week I used AI to help give me some ideas for our group project charter. 
I also explored a little with Claude and realized that I liked using Claude more compared to ChatGPT.
I did not use AI for the Week 2 exercises this week.

Week 3 
This week I experimented with claude and used it to help me debug some problems on the week 3 exercises. I also utilized it to give me examples when I was struggling. For the most part of the exercises I was able to complete them on my own however there were some instances where claude helped me to understand where I went wrong when I had to debug.
