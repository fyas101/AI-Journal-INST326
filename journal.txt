Week 1
This week I used AI to help give me some examples while I was completing the week 1 exercises. 
I was a little lost at first since I am fairly new to coding and haven't coded since INST126 but after
asking ChatGPT and Gemini for some example codes using f-strings and strip(), I was able to get a refresher of
these concepts and continue to complete the exercises myself. I did not use AI for debugging.
