Week 1
This week I used AI to help give me some examples while I was completing the week 1 exercises. 
I was a little lost at first since I am fairly new to coding and haven't coded since INST126 but after
asking ChatGPT and Gemini for some example codes using f-strings and strip(), I was able to get a refresher of
these concepts and continue to complete the exercises myself. I did not use AI for debugging.

Week 2
This week I used AI to help give me some ideas for our group project charter. 
I also explored a little with Claude and realized that I liked using Claude more compared to ChatGPT.
I did not use AI for the Week 2 exercises this week.

Week 3 
This week I experimented with claude and used it to help me debug some problems on the week 3 exercises. 
I also utilized it to give me examples when I was struggling. For the most part of the exercises 
I was able to complete them on my own however there were some instances where claude helped me to 
understand where I went wrong when I had to debug.

Week 4
This week I utilized claude to help me understand some coding concepts. 
I asked it to help explain creating classes and show me some examples. 
This then helped me to complete the week 04 exercises. 
I did not use claude for the actual coding in the exercises or debugging this week.

Week 5
This week I utilized claude to help me debug some of the week 5 exercises. Specifically, exercises 14 and 16.
I also utilized it to help explain some coding concepts and functions such as how and when to use a ValueError
as well as some examples. This then allowed me to include a ValueError function into some of the exercises for
this week.

Week 6
This week I utilized claude to help teach me how  to create classes and also refresh my memory on some coding concepts such as parsing while I was completing the weekly exercises. This refresher then allowed me to work on my group project as well.
